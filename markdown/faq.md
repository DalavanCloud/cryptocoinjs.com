### 1. How is this different than [BitcoinJS][bitcoinjs] or [Bitcore][bitcore]?

CryptoCoinJS and Bitcore both derive their roots from an older version of BitcoinJS. For a long period of time BitcoinJS went unmaintained and many forks emerged. There was an opportunity to create a library that broke down each piece of functionality into its own module for the sake of making the library easier to user and easier to maintain. Let's face it, understanding Bitcoin is difficult, let alone programming with it - we as developers need to make things as easy as possible to attract faster innovation.

Since BitcoinJS is now maintained again and Bitpay has developers working full-time on Bitcore, both of these libraries are attractive options to use for your next Bitcoin/JavaScript project.
