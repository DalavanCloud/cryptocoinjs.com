bigi
======

JavaScript library to manipulate big integers. Package of `jsbn` made by [Tom Wu](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/jsbn/)

Pronounced either like "big I" or "biggie".

**Important Note**: Please don't use this library for actual big integer operations. We may aggressively prune the library so that it just supports operations necessary for CryptoCoinJS. This is still up for debate and isn't a priority at the moment.

### Node.js/Browserify
