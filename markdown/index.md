CryptoCoinJS
============

CryptoCoinJS is a JavaScript project that helps you to interface and program with various crypto currencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, etc. Most of the modules are fully compatible with the browser and Node.js. Naturally, the modules that are interface directly with peer nodes won't run in the browser.
